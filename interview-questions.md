# UNIT 2 ASSESSMENT: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. Tip: providing an example can help communicate your point if you struggle with the vocabulary.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: A parameter is a placeholder for any given value in a function. Parameters help to prevent the "hard coding" of functions. An argument is the actual value being passed to the function. When passed, the argument will take the place of the placeholder.

Researched answer: Parameters are the variables inside the parentheses in a function definition. Arguments are the values that are passed to the function when it's invoked.

2. What is the difference between an object and a class?

Your answer: I think the main difference is the purpose they serve. An object is a composite data type meant to hold and store other data types. Classes are reusable blueprints meant to create objects and encapsulate related functions.

Researched answer: A class is a template that describes a predefined structure and behavior of an object. An object is an instance of a class.

3. What is iteration?

Your answer: Iteration is the process of looping until a condition is met.

Researched answer: Repetition until a specified condition evaluates to false.

4. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Answer: Hoisting is the act of moving all declarations to the top of the scope, prior to executing the code. This allows for the use of functions and variables before they've been declared, prevents errors related to accessing variables before they've been declared, and can improve readbility of code.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Unit

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. React State: React state is a type of hook that which allows the dev to create a variable with an initial value and a way to update the value as needed. I think of it as an upgraded version of an event listener in vanilla js. They both enable dynamic behavior by allowing components to react to changes.

2. React Props: Props (short for properties) are arguments passed into React components. Props are passed from parent to child using dot notation, allowing the child component to use the data provided by its parent.

3. DOM events: DOM events are registered changes in the DOM. DOM events can be initiated by user actions such as clicking, or, in the context of react, changes in state. Ultimately DOM events allow for the interactiveness and responsiveness of websites.
